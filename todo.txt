Things the db needs to do

Basic ::--
    Write:-
        -Done   (F_Write)   write to only file
        -Done   (M_Write)   write to only memory
        -Done   (write_Now) write to both
        -Done   (write)     write to memory slowly to file
        -Done   (writeAll)  write everything
    Read:-
        -Done   (readByIndex)   read data by index
        -Done   (readByField)   read by field and value
        -Hold   read data by index range                    
        -Hold   read data by field value range              
    Delete:-
        -Done   (F_delete)  delete from file
        -Done   (M_delete)  delete from memory
        -Done   (delete_Now)delete from both
        -Done   (delete)    delete from memory slowly from file
    Alter:-
        -Done   (F_alter)   alter in only file
        -Done   (M_alter)   alter in only memory
        -Done   (alter_Now) alter in both
        -Done   (alter)     alter in memory slowly in file
    Alter key:-
        -Done   (keyAlter)      alter in both
        -Done   (keyAlter_Now)  alter in memory slowly in file

Write to multiple ::--
    Concept:
    take the key and make a group of 10K items 
    if the key is a tuple split size for every item
    
    have a list of loaded files
    remove if last used was 1min ago
    if file is loaded in the list use it else open and load

    calculate which group to add to and check of the file to write to
    FileStream:-
        -Plan open
        -Plan read
        -Plan close

    Grouping:-
        -Done   (getGroup)      getGroup  
        -Done   (loadGroup)     loadGroup
        -Done   (unloadGroup)   saveGroup
    Read:-
        -Done   (readByKey) readByKey
        -Plan readByField
        -Plan readByKey Range
        -Plan readByField Range
    Write:-
        -Plan writeToGroup
        -Plan write
